# Tech Language

One of the best parts about becoming a programmer is that you get to learn
whole new messed up ways to use the English language. It's one of the many
ways we can tell the difference between "our people" and fakers.

## Procedure

* You'll be divided into groups of 4-5
* Each group will be given a "situation"
* For your given situation, write a dialog between two characters that uses
as much *programming jargon* as possible. Maybe mix in some subtle digs,
judgements, and microaggressions. Imagine it's like The Internet -- no accountability.
* Elect two members from your group to play out the dialog for the larger group.

## Dialogs

### A: The Pair

Persons A and B are about to start a two-week-long pair programming assignment.
B is a bit nervous, but A is confident. The pair needs to have a "DTR"-type
conversation to get their work started.

### B: The Conference

Persons A and B are awkwardly standing near each other at a programming conference
happy hour. There are no existing conversations nearby that they can latch on to,
so they'll have to talk to each other.

### C: The Interview

Person A is interviewing for a software development job at Person B's company.
Person A is new to the industry and eager to prove themselves. Person B' has been
programming for 20 years and is skeptical of newcomers.

### D: The Recruiter

Person A is a technical recruiter tasked with finding great people for their
clients. Person B is a programmer not sure if they should be hunting for a new
job. They're curious but not "job hunting," per se.

### E: The "That Guy"

Every conference or user group talk seems to have "that guy." Person A is trying
to deliver an informative, appropriate conference talk. Person B, in the audience,
is mostly interested in asking questions / raising objections that highlight
just how smart Person B is.

### F: The Significant Other

Once in awhile we have to talk to "the normals" out there in the world. Person A,
a lovely programming student, is attempting to talk with Person B whose
significant other is a programmer, but Person B is not technical -- as far as
Person A knows/assumes.

## Post-Discussion

* What are some of the key words/phrases we heard more than once? Why?
* Why do we use "jargon" as an industry? Is that always the case?
* What are some ways to overcome jargon? Study it?
